            <br>
            <p>It’s a simple task, right? To fry an egg, you throw some butter in a pan, break an egg into it, and in a few minutes you have breakfast. (Or maybe dinner or lunch!)         It’s not complicated, but even something as simple as frying an egg has its nuances.</p>

            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 to 2 teaspoons butter or oliv oil, depending on your pan type</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="bold">Instructions</h2>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold">Heat the pan: </span>Melt the butter or heat the oil in your skillet over low heat for 1 minute. Use 1 teaspoon of butter or oil per egg if using a nonstick skillet or well-seasoned cast iron skillet. Use 2 teaspoons of butter or oil if you're using a stainless steel skillet. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Cook the egg on the heat: </span>Break the egg into the skillet, and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, covered, or until all but a thin rim of egg white around each yolk is opaque.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Finish cooking the egg off the heat: </span>Remove the pan from the heat, keep covered, and let sit for about 30 seconds to finish cooking. If you want to make an over-easy egg, use a thin spatula and slide it directly under the yolk. Gently lift the egg and flip it over, and let it cook for 10 to 15 seconds. Add a few more seconds a piece for both over-medium and over-hard.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Serve: </span>Remove the lid. Slide a spatula directly under the yolk when removing from the pan and serve.</li>
